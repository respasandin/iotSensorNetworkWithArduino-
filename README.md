# Data display and control of an IoT sensor network using Arduino

Industrial engineering project that seeks to control a wireless sensor network through Wi-Fi using:
- Industrial Arduino 101 module
- PH and conductivity sensors

The network is based on wireless connection.
A central PC that allows to represent the information of all sensors graphically in real-time with a variable update interval,
eligible by the user, as well as storing all the values in a database in the cloud

## Project requirements & set up

- Arduino 101 industrial module
- Linux/MacOS/Windows PC
- Sensors
- MAMP 
- Database 

## Usage
Run App, insert a time interval in seconds. 

To check real time values of the sensors press `Conectar` to see all historic values press `Base de datos`
